# Overview

*The problem*: Students in the UH system often lose touch with their high-school friends due to their increased workload and other commitments.  They want to meet up with their friends and other alumni, but because there are no easy ways to create events and find other interested people, they often don’t. In another scenario, some students come from the mainland and would like to meet new people who are from or around the same area as them, but again, as there are no easy ways to meet these other people, they don’t.

*The solution*: This application will facilitate coordinated get-togethers of UH students from the same mainland state or who graduated from the same high-school	. This will allow new out-of-state students to find potential friends with similar backgrounds as they acclimate to Hawaii. For Hawaii high-school graduates, the application will enable casual reunion hangouts for former classmates to catch up and see how each other are doing.

# Mockup page ideas
  * Some possible mockup pages include:
  * Public Landing page
  * Login page
  * User profile page
  * Browse Groups page
  * Specific Group page
  * Specific Group Events page

# Use case ideas
  * Whether or not the following bullet points list all pages or not, the completed use case should show an end-to-end scenario of using the system.
  * New user goes to landing page, creates an account, sets up profile
  * User goes to landing page, logs in, goes to profile page, edits profile
  * User logs in, browses groups filtered by location or high-school, views a group’s page, signs-up for an event

# Beyond the basics
  * Option to create specific interest groups (video games, reading, cooking, etc.)
