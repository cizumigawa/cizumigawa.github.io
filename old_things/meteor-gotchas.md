# Meteor is Meatier

Meteor is a great framework if you have the time to master and understand the setup process for an application and the heirarchy of the projects.  However, like most college students trying to hold down 15 credits, a job, and some side projects, meteor's interconectedness and sometimes unintuitive heirachry can make the task of creating a website even more difficult than it has to be. 
When I say that "meteor is meatier," I mean that meteor is much more involved than just using regular JavaScript and HTML.  Because the framework focuses on breaking down the components of your website and organizing them into different folders and files, you are required to spend more time on learning how and where files can and cannot go.  For example, in our Digits practices, when we were asked to create links or routes to new pages, because I was unfamiliar with the meteor framework, instead of adding a new page to the correct folder and importing the proper files, I was trying to put '<a>'s everywhere, trying to figure out how to link my home page to the new 'Contacts' page.
The framework itself is a great idea for large, meatier projects; it helps keep you organized.

# Error Messages

ESLint provides helpful error messages and easy solutions to correcting the errors. However, Meteor does not.  When I receive errors in Meteor, I have absolutely no idea what the problem is or in what folder and file it is in.  In C/C++, compilers can give you these types of messages, but since Meteor is not a compiler, it can't alert you when certain lines of code in your project are giving you problems.
Maybe I just don't understand the error messages, but I think it'd be more helpful if they had better messages.
