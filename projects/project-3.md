summary: A matrix calculator and GUI developed for EE 205.
---

This project was a collaborative effort made by my EE 205 group. 
My responsibility for this project was to create the GUI for the calculator. Qt Creator widgets and Qt GUI libraries were used to implement the GUI. Because Qt is a cross-platform IDE, although I programmed the GUI on a Mac computer, the executabele works on OSX, Linux, and Windows operating systems.
