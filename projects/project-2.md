COSMOS (Comprehensive Open-architecture Solution for Mission Operations Systems) is a framework which provides support for many different aspects of flight software and ground station tools. The [COSMOS Project](http://cosmos-project.org/) is an extensive framework built on C++ and object-oriented programming concepts.

For this project, I co-developed the ADCS (Attitude Determination and Control System) library in COSMOS to be used in future satellite missions.
