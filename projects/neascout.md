summary: This past summer, I spent 10 weeks in Alabama creating GUIs for the NASA NEA Scout ground station software.

For this project, I worked closely with the NASA NEA Scout Mission Operations team in Huntsville, Alabama. The NEA Scout project is based on the idea of sending a satellite into Near Earth Orbit to monitor and dectect potentially threatening asteroids. The Mission Operations team consists of satellite operators who will monitor the satellite's performance as it orbits earth. During flight, the operators must query for telemetry data that is sent down from the satellite. This task requires the use of ground station software with a command line interface. Because most team members do not have prior experience with command line, my project was to create GUIs for them so that they could query telemetry in a more intuitive way.
