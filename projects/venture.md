Venture UH Manoa is an interactive website that allows people within the UH community to stay updated on the latest events.

This website boasts the following features:
 - Pleasing Aesthetics
 - Event Scheduling and Planning
 - Advanced Friend and Event Searches

This project was created with JavaScript, Meteor, MongoDB, and Semantic UI, and was accomplished in a small group consisting of three developers.
My contribution to this project dealt mainly with the development of the website's databases in MongoDB, the 'Create' and 'Edit' events pages, the routing of the pages, and the correcting of ESLint errors.
