Venture UH Manoa is an interactive website that allows people within the UH community to stay updated on the latest events.

Venture boasts many features:
 - Pleasing Aesthetics
 - Event Scheduling and Advertisement
 - Advanced Friend and Event Searches

Venture was created with JavaScript, Meteor, MongoDB, and Semantic UI, and was accomplished in a small group consisting of three developers.
My contribution to this project dealt mainly with the development of the website's databases in MongoDB, the 'Create' and 'Edit' event pages, the routing of the pages, and the correcting of ESLint errors.
