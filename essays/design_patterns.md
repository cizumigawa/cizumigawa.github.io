# Design Patterns

Design patterns are often described as general solutions to common software problems.  Algorithms are specific to software problems and describe the direct solution to a problem, but design patterns are even more general in the sense that they describe the overall layout and numbers of data and objects rather than how to solve a specific problem.  There are three main subsets of design patterns: creational, structural, and behavioral.  In my previous programming experiences, I have followed a variety of design patterns, but the one that I enjoy the most is the mediator design pattern.

While the design pattern is literally named "Mediator," I see the mediator as a coordinator between the different program objects and nodes rather than a mediator.  While a mediator normally refers to someone who helps resolve conflicts, the pattern seems more like a coordinator which accepts responses from the objects in its control but ultimately decides the overall timing and tasks of the different objects.
