Because the majority of my programming classes and projects are done with C/C++, I am more familiar with the C/C++ style of programming than Javascript. However, after doing Python programming projects and developing an interest in Node.js this past summer, I am beginning to realize that most programming languages are fairly similar in terms of syntax and logic.

Syntactically, Javascript reminds me of Python and C++.  The comments, loops, and need for semicolons are very C-like, while the variable declarations are similar to Python.

Although I haven't compeleted this course or my Node.js projects yet, I am developing a growing interest in the new frameworks and services provided by new languages.
